                            David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                            students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                            statement that it was all their original work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find three
                            pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given that the
                            students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'

                        <p>
                            Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject. But IT
                            lecturers are a funny lot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff, as there was
                            a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop to the network and tried
                            to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update the laptop to IE7. I logged off and
                            asked her to log on with her account to try IE7.

                        <p>
                            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident with a
                            part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago. "I work in a vocational education
                            library, and, on night shift, library staff are the default computer
                            technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time lecturer came to the counter, stating
                            that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit
                            foolish, because she was instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the
                            problem in front of a room full of students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out popped the
                            tray and... no disc to be seen.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="article-title">CD drive</h2>
                        <p>
                            Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up, 'That's the CD drive? I
                            thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there
                            even though the drives themselves had long since been decommissioned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine and it fell out.
                            Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back, she was back within five minutes,
                            saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'
                        </p>
